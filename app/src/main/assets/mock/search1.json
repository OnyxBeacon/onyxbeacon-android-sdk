      "blurb": "Hello. My name s Marika and I am professor in Arts on Warsaw  University on painting field. Painting is also my hobby. Since 10 years I've tried to discover the heritage of european paintings. I have a big dream to create the album collecting the arts corresponding to the taste of people of out century. The definition of beauty changes a lot during past two centuries. Something what two hundred years ago was considered as the masterpiece, today is misunderstendable. However we assume, that we should not undermine the art expert's opinion even if we are not convinced about their beauty and singularity. I was observing this occurence of \"accepting the compositions\" a year ago during our visit in Louvre, Paris. We conducted the survey in which asked  the visitors to choose one of five arts of the artist, which delight him the most, and then the arts, which in his opinion are the most appreciated, valued or showed as an example of composition. the answers were surprising. The paintings the most associated with the painter, presented in brochures, exhibited in the museums all over the world weren't covered with those- in visitor's opinion- the most beautiful. My goal is simple- during the year, beginning form August 28, which is the date of collection the sum of money needed to project completion, together with the students from \"love renesans\" student club we will research the artistic taste of people age 16-99. We will ask about taking part in short survey, in which they choose on of the most beautiful-in their opinion- masterpieces of every of 30 european master painters. The scores will let us create the unique album, corresponding to the contemporary canon of beauty. I am convinced that project implementation, in which also you can have your part, not only will contribute to cognition a great amount of forgotten and unappreciated by the art experts arts, but also will let the people who don't have any contact with the art in everyday life find their favourite artist. Today the visitors can have no idea of the artist's existence because of unpopularity of his arts, but who knows, if exactly this arts won't meet the artistic expectations of the visitors.",

      "blurb": "A famous saying of Confucius goes: \"Do everything so that honesty pays off more than theft, but is not theft\". To answer this quote I decided to create an aplication, which can lead to overuse, but in many situation it becomes very helpful, especially when tickets have become more expensive and for many people have become a financial burden. Many times we forget to buy a ticket and we dont have enough money or the ability to do this. Then the ideal solution becomes my app. The app \"Without a Ticket\" is based on the idea of mutaual help through the exchange of information. The users exchange between themselves information on the topic of ticket inspectors in means of communication (in Poland this is mainly ZTM and PKP), everyone has the ability to observe their availibility taking into acount all the registrations as well as limiting oureves to a certain areas. The creation if the application isnt bankruptcy or stealing from the transportation companies but to help in extreme cases in which  you can find an honest person who pays for their means of transportation. Thats why the application is equipped with a barrier which guarantees  from too much use of the app. information about the presence of inspectors can be heard 24h but to gathering the information only 2 times a month. Other than the main function \"Without\" a ticket has many options allowing for communication, mutual gaming, or gaining points . In the offer you will find premium and super premium accounts giving extra abilities.  Don't waste time and use the app now and connect to create mutual help!",

I think very practically, my life dream has always been doing something for people, creating something which helps with everyday life. Realizing my idea took many years, there was testing, the first prototype, how to accomplish my goal which ended in failure many times. Today I stand in front of you with the fruit of my effort and struggles with a gadget which will revolutionize the always hated heavy lifting. I present to you \"The Strong Hand\" one of a kind handle which causes that the weight held in your hand will disperse evenly and this eill help you carry lift and move even more. the nightmare of not being able to lift something will be gone. your days of asking for help are over, and ordinary task will become fun and they will gain new meaning. The Strong Hand is not a thing you have encountered before, it is completely new idea crated by myself for you. the simple mechanism which is used by lifts, it spreads the entire weight across your palm not focusing on one specific point. Thanks to this the weight lifted by us seems lighter.  There is a whole range of use for the gadget beginning with groceries, ending with house renovations, caring for children or older people, or handicapped who need to be taken care of.",

His idea became his everything, he spent years of research to create this, which then inspired me to change my life plan. His goal was to create a lotion/cream , that eliminates wrinkles in 60 seconds. When he told me about his work in this field I didn't believe what I heard, there are many similar products on the market but in reality they dont guve the wanted effects, which are shown in commercials. But I agreed to sacrifice myself for 10 min, which turned out to be the best choice of my life. My thinking took a 180 degree turn and lead to my career choice I am now in a place where ideas and technology need financial support and where big dreams plead to become true. I have exactly 30 days, on KickMaterial, to raise money necessary to prosuce the first \"Kiss Beauty\" I know that there is no second place where people. with real interests support and observe the needs of technologic talents. Thats why were counting on you. Thomas and I, we believe that you will help us win life.",

A special sound not tolerated by bugs creates a great barrier, which they cannot cross. Same with the Super Toperz. Bats are blind, in turn they send out special waves, which bounce off obstacles guiding them through the air. My invention sends out a wave which is considered an obstacle by the bat, with this we can somewhat control the flight of the bat.
