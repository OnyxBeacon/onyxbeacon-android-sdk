Bats have a special body build  hind limbs which they have to thank for this ability.\". This description of these animals doesn't sound scary but I assure you that you will change your mind when one of these creatures flies into your room or gets tangled in your hair Its possible you have encountered gadgets used to scare away mosquitos. A special sound not tolerated by bugs creates a great barrier, which they cannot cross. Same with the Super Toperz. Bats are blind, in turn they send out special waves, which bounce off obstacles guiding them through the air. My invention sends out a wave which is considered an obstacle by the bat, with this we can somewhat control the flight of the bat. Pilot allows to set up a wall that all mammals will be restricted from.",
